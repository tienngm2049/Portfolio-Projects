# Portfolio Project 03 - Customer Segmentation with PCA and Clustering

Welcome to my third portfolio project! Here's a guide on how to navigate through my project:

- The `.html` file is designed for reading purposes only.
- To interact with the code and analysis, you can use the `.ipynb` file. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required libraries and packages if you wish to rerun the code.
- The dataset used for this project is named `marketing_campaign.csv`, sourced from Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

Feel free to explore the project and delve into the insights it provides!
