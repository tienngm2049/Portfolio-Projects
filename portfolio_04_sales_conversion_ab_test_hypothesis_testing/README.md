Welcome to my fourth portfolio project! Here's a guide on how to navigate through my project:

- The `.html` file is intended for reading purposes only.
- To interact with the code and analysis, you can use the `.ipynb` file. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, along with the necessary libraries and packages if you wish to rerun the code.
- The dataset utilized for this project is named `KAG_conversion_data.csv`.

Feel free to explore the project and dive into the insights it offers regarding sales conversion optimization through A/B testing and hypothesis testing!
