# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! As a passionate learner in the fields of Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Analysis, I've undertaken diverse projects that highlight my journey through data exploration, analysis, and machine learning. Additionally, my love for classic Literature, Philosophy, and Psychology has influenced my analytical thinking and problem-solving approach. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the projects I've undertaken:

## Project 01 - IMDB Movie Data Analysis

In my first project, I embarked on an exhilarating journey to analyze the top 1000 movies listed on IMDB. Through web scraping, I collected a wealth of data, delved into comprehensive exploratory data analysis, and uncovered insightful patterns. This project sharpened my web scraping skills, honed my data preprocessing proficiency, and showcased my expertise in extracting meaningful insights through data visualization.

## Project 03 - Customer Segmentation with PCA and Clustering

Project 03 ventured into customer segmentation by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques. Working with a rich dataset from a grocery firm, I uncovered valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. This project showcased my proficiency in advanced data analysis, including data dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, and customer segmentation. These insights contributed to optimizing products and services to cater to diverse customer needs and behaviors.
