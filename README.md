## Portfolio Project 01 - Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis - Top 1000 IMDB Movies

In this project, I embarked on a journey to explore and analyze the top 1000 movies listed on IMDB (Internet Movie Database), one of the most prominent sources for movie-related information. The primary objectives of this project were to gather data through web scraping, clean and preprocess the collected data, and then perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis to extract meaningful insights.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Web Scraping:** I used web scraping techniques to extract information about the top 1000 movies from IMDB. This involved navigating through web pages, fetching movie details, ratings, cast, directors, genres, and more. Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests were invaluable tools in this process.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Raw data from web scraping often requires careful cleaning and formatting. I addressed missing values, corrected data types, and standardized variables to ensure consistency and accuracy.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** With the cleaned dataset in hand, I delved into exploratory data analysis. By utilizing Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I created visualizations and summary statistics to uncover interesting patterns and trends within the dataset. I examined features such as movie ratings, genres, release years, and directors' contributions.

- **Insights and Conclusions:** The EDA phase enabled me to draw meaningful conclusions and insights from the dataset. I identified factors contributing to highly-rated movies, explored genre popularity over time, and analyzed the distribution of ratings across decades. These findings provided a deeper understanding of the characteristics that make a movie stand out.

- **Data Visualization:** I leveraged various data visualization techniques to present my findings visually. This included creating bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to effectively communicate patterns and correlations within the dataset.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Through this project, I honed my web scraping skills and gained valuable experience in handling real-world data that required thorough cleaning and preprocessing.

- I acquired a practical understanding of exploratory data analysis techniques, enabling me to extract meaningful insights and tell a compelling story through data visualization.

- The project showcased my ability to utilize Python libraries and tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in a real-world context.

Overall, "Portfolio Project 01 - Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis Top 1000 IMDB Movies" is a testament to my hands-on skills in data acquisition, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis, demonstrating my capability to transform raw data into actionable insights through a comprehensive data-driven approach.
