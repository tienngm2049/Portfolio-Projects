# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! As a passionate learner in the fields of Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Analysis, I've undertaken diverse projects that highlight my journey through data exploration, analysis, and machine learning. Additionally, my love for classic Literature, Philosophy, and Psychology has influenced my analytical thinking and problem-solving approach. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the projects I've undertaken:

## Project 01 - IMDB Movie Data Analysis

In this project, I embarked on a captivating journey to explore and analyze the top 1000 movies listed on IMDB. I utilized web scraping to collect data, conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis, and uncovered insightful patterns. The project honed my web scraping skills, data preprocessing proficiency, and expertise in extracting meaningful insights through data visualization.
