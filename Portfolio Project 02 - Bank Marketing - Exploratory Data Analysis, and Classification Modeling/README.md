# Portfolio Project 02 - Bank Marketing Analysis

Welcome to my second portfolio project! In this project, I've explored the realm of bank marketing, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Classification Modeling. The objective was to extract insights from the data and construct predictive models to support the bank's marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

Within this project, I've engaged with the following key components:

- `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.html`: This HTML file comprises an extensive report detailing my analysis. It encompasses visualizations, discoveries, and elucidations of the procedures undertaken during both EDA and classification modeling.
- `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file encompasses the code employed for the analysis. It serves as a comprehensive guide, walking through the EDA process, data preprocessing, and the creation of classification models.
- `bank+marketing/`: This folder contains the datasets used in the analysis.

## What's Included

- In-Depth EDA & Visualization: I've conducted an exhaustive exploratory data analysis to unearth patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset.
- Classification Models: I've deployed machine learning classification models to predict outcomes pertinent to the bank's clients subscribing to term deposits.

## How to Navigate This Repository

1. **Explore the Report**: Open the `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.html` file to delve into the comprehensive analysis, findings, and visual representations.
2. **Replicate the Analysis**: To replicate the analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebook `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.ipynb`. Execute the cells to recreate the steps undertaken during the project.
3. **Questions and Feedback**: If you have queries or feedback, don't hesitate to contact me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project! I trust that the insights and methodologies presented herein are both intriguing and enlightening.
