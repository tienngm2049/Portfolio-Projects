# Portfolio Project 02 - Bank Marketing Analysis

Welcome to my second portfolio project! In this project, I've delved into the world of bank marketing, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Classification Modeling. The goal was to gain insights from the data and build predictive models to aid in the bank's marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've worked with two main files:

- `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.html`: This HTML file contains the comprehensive report of my analysis. It includes visualizations, findings, and explanations of the steps I took in both EDA and classification modeling.
- `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code I used for the analysis. It's a step-by-step guide to how I performed EDA, prepared the data, and built classification models.

## What's Included

- Detailed EDA: I've conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the bank marketing dataset.
- Classification Models: I've implemented machine learning classification models to predict outcomes relevant to the bank's marketing efforts.
- Visualizations: The HTML report includes interactive visualizations that help in understanding the data and model performance.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore the Report**: Open the `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.html` file to read through the complete analysis, findings, and visualizations.
2. **Code Replication**: To replicate the analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebook `Bank Marketing - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Modeling.ipynb`. You can run the cells to reproduce the steps I've taken.
3. **Questions and Feedback**: If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me via email or linkedin.

Thank you for checking out my project! I hope you find the insights and methodologies presented here both interesting and informative.

Best regards,
