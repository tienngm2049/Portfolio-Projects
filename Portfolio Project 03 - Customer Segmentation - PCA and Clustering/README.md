# Portfolio Project 03 - Customer Segmentation with PCA and Clustering

Welcome to my third portfolio project! In this project, I embark on a journey to gain deeper insights into a grocery firm's customer database. The primary objective is customer segmentation, a crucial practice that involves categorizing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. By doing so, the aim is to enhance our understanding of customer behavior and tailor products and services to meet their diverse needs and preferences.

## Understanding the Dataset

## Project Overview
Within this project, I've engaged with the following key components:

- **Customer Segmentation Report**: The project includes an extensive HTML report titled "Customer Segmentation - PCA and Clusterings.html." This report provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis, findings, and methodologies employed.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The associated Jupyter Notebook, "Customer Segmentation - PCA and Clusterings.ipynb," contains the complete code used during the analysis. It serves as a detailed guide, walking you through the entire process, from data preprocessing to clustering.

Stay tuned for the exciting insights and methodologies that will be uncovered in this project!
