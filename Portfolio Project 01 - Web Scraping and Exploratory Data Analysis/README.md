# Portfolio Project 01 - IMDB Movie Data Analysis

Welcome to my first portfolio project! Here's how to navigate my project:

- The `.html` file is for reading only.
- The `.ipynb` file can be opened with Jupyter Notebook. If you wish to rerun the code, please install Jupyter Notebook first and the necessary libraries and packages.
- The dataset, `top_1000_imdb_movies_data.csv`, was created through web scraping.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the insights from this project!
